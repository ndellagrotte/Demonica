/**
 * Normalizes the external frame numbers handed to {@link RenderSectionManager} into one
 * strictly increasing sequence.
 *
 * <p>The terrain pass and the shadow pass are driven by two independent external counters: the
 * vanilla frame counter, and the shadow renderer's own counter which restarts from zero whenever
 * the shader pipeline is rebuilt. The manager archives and compares frame numbers in several
 * places — lattice visit stamps, {@code lastUpdatedFrame}, build times and the per-section
 * submission/build frames — and every comparison assumes a single monotonic sequence. A counter
 * that jumps backwards poisons those comparisons: searches skip cells carrying a stamp from the
 * "future", and finished build results are discarded as stale without releasing their
 * cancellation token.</p>
 *
 * <p>Feeding every external frame through this clock keeps the internal sequence monotonic while
 * preserving caller order within a game frame: the first caller takes the next number and later
 * callers of the same frame take higher numbers. Not thread-safe; the section manager only calls
 * it from the render thread.</p>
