/**
 * Camera-centered spatial index backing the occlusion visibility traversal.
 *
 * <p>The lattice is a dense, flat window around the camera. It gives the
 * traversal constant-time access to a section and to its six neighbours,
 * while avoiding an object allocation for every cell on the hot path.
 *
 * <p>This class has two layers of state:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code sections} is the authoritative set of every attached section.
 *       It is used for world-coordinate lookup and for rebuilding the window.</li>
 *   <li>The lattice is a dense X/Z window containing the attached sections
 *       that can participate in the current search. A section outside that
 *       window remains attached, but has no lattice slot until a rebase brings
 *       it inside the window.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The lattice is therefore an index of {@code sections}, not a second
 * collection or an overflow cache; {@code latticeSection} only contains the
 * subset that is currently installed.
 *
 * <p>The arrays are parallel: for a given lattice index,
 * {@code latticeSection}, {@code sectionMeta}, and {@code regionOfCell}
 * describe the same cell. X and Z are camera-windowed, while Y covers the
 * entire world height. The window is allocated lazily by
 * {@link #ensureWindowCovers}. The first call allocates the arrays and then
 * establishes their base coordinates. If a later camera position no longer
 * fits, a same-sized window is normally slid in place: the overlapping cells
 * are copied, and only the newly exposed X/Z band is looked up in
 * {@code sections}. A resize or a move with no overlap falls back to a full
 * {@link #rebase}.
 *
 * <p>The installable interior ({@code [1, dim-2]} on each axis) is wrapped by
 * a permanent one-cell ring of sentinel cells (index {@code 0} and
 * {@code dim-1}). Every installable cell therefore has a valid array index one
 * step away in all six directions, so traversal can add a value from
 * {@link #delta} without a bounds check: the neighbour is always in-array,
 * whether it holds another cell or a sentinel. The border ring is never
 * installable, even when the window holds no sections.
 *
 * <p>The normal lifecycle is construction with no lattice allocation, followed
 * by {@link #ensureWindowCovers}, which allocates and establishes the window,
 * then attachment/detachment and metadata updates between searches, and finally
 * {@link #findVisible}. Structural state is single-threaded: attachment,
 * detachment, metadata updates, allocation, and rebasing must not overlap the
 * search. The search may run asynchronously and writes per-frame visit state
 * itself, but its array lengths, window coordinates, and installed membership
 * must remain stable for its duration. {@code RenderListManager} enforces this
 * boundary.
