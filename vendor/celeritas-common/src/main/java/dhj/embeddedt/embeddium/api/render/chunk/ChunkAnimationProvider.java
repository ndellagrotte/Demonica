 * renderer, mirroring the per-RenderChunk {@code glTranslate} offset that vanilla chunk rendering
 * supports. A provider is queried on the render thread for every visible section on every render
 * pass; when it reports an offset, the section is removed from its region's multi-draw batch and
 * drawn separately with the offset added to the region model matrix.</p>
 *
 * <p>The vanilla equivalent is the Chunk Animator hook on {@code ChunkRenderContainer#preRenderChunk}
 * plus {@code RenderChunk#setOrigin}: this interface adapts both to the celeritas pipeline, where
 * vanilla {@code RenderChunk} objects are not created or drawn.</p>
