/**
 * Receiver-driven, light-monotone visibility search for a directional shadow pass.
 *
 * <p>A section can only cast a shadow the player sees if it lies on a light ray through a point the camera can
 * see. The search therefore starts from every cell the main pass reported visible and expands only toward the light,
 * through the face-pair visibility graph, until a blocker. Blockers are reported (they are shadow casters) but do not
 * get queued for further traversal. This design means geometry the camera cannot see (such as the surface sections
 * above an enclosed cave) is never reached.
 *
 * <p>Less things depend on the camera position than the standard occlusion culler. The outward-direction and
 * angle-refinement masks follow from the light vector alone and are constant for the whole search, and there is no
 * angular aperture to track.
 *
 * <p>In this culler variant, a section is not necessarily dequeued only once. A later arrival through a
 * previously unused incoming face can widen the exits available to that section, so it must be enqueued and expanded
 * again. {@code REPORTED_BIT} prevents duplicate visitor reports. (The main culler avoids this by normally enqueuing
 * only one root and expanding outwards. This guarantees every path to a cell arrives at the same queue depth, so
 * all incoming apertures are merged before that cell is dequeued. Edge cases needing multiple roots disable aperture
 * clamping to sidestep the problem.)
 *
 * <p>The search stamps {@link SectionLattice#shadowVisitState}, leaving the main search's state intact, and reads
 * the root set from {@link SectionLattice#visibleCells}, so it must run after the main search for the same frame.
