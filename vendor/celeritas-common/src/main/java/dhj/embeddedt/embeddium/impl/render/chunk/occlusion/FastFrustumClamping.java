/*
 * A packed aperture stores the xy, xz and yz angular intervals in six lanes of a single long.
 *
 * Lanes are 10 bits wide and hold a 9-bit rank; the tenth bit is a spare used to allow lanewise addition
 * and subtraction without spilling into neighbours. Lanes 0..2 hold the *complemented*
 * lower ranks (RANK_MASK - lower) and lanes 3..5 the upper ranks, which makes intersection a lane-wise
 * minimum and the hull a lane-wise maximum across all six lanes at once. Both are done with SWAR, so
 * the hot path never unpacks an interval.
