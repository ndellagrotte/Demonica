/**
 * Limits how far from the camera the raster tests and draws sections, so its per-frame cost tracks how much it
 * is culling. Sections beyond the limit are treated as visible, which is always conservative.
 *
 * <p>The limit is a squared chunk distance. Each frame the yield of the tests inside it (fraction not visible)
 * feeds a moving average: above {@link #HIGH_YIELD} the limit doubles, below {@link #LOW_YIELD} it halves, in
 * between it holds. It never drops below {@link #FLOOR}, which acts as a standing probe, and stops at the ceiling
 * the search supplies, at which point the search is a full, unbudgeted pass.
 *
 * <p>Limiting by distance rather than by count matters: the search runs roughly front to back, so everything
 * inside the limit is drawn before anything it could hide, and the yield measured there is representative.
 *
 * <p>Representative of the inside, that is: an occluder beyond the limit is never drawn, so whatever it hides is
 * never seen to be hidden, and a cliff a few chunks off would hold the limit at the floor for as long as the
 * camera stood there. So every {@link #PROBE_PERIOD} frames one frame runs unbudgeted, and when that pass pays
 * for itself the limit jumps straight to it.
 *
 * <p>Yield cannot say whether it pays: a hidden section also stops the search behind it, so one cull removes a
 * single section from the frame on gentle hills and dozens on cave-riddled terrain, at a similar yield. The probe
 * instead compares the frame's visible count against the average of the frames before it, which, the camera
 * having barely moved, is what the pass removed, and charges that against the tests it added.
