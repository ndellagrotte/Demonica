/**
 * The vanilla main framebuffer uses a plain GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24 renderbuffer. The
 * non-stencil branch of Lumenized's hookDepthBuffer binds that renderbuffer to
 * GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT, which does not match its format, leaving the bloom FBO
 * without a usable depth attachment — every bloom pass then draws through walls.
 *
 * <p>Re-binding the same renderbuffer to GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT (the format it actually
 * has) is idempotent with the first bind in the method and makes depth testing work.
