/**
 * Reports the multiplier a foreign mod is currently applying to the alpha channel of item vertex

 *
 * <p>Demonica renders lit items through a fast path that appends baked quads straight to the vertex
 * buffer and, for stable models, caches the result in a GLSM display list. Both shortcuts assume
 * the vertex colours are a pure function of the baked quad data. NeverEnoughAnimation breaks that
 * assumption: while a GUI opens or closes it scales the alpha of every item vertex, so the fast path
 * either drops the fade or bakes the alpha of the compile frame into the display list. Registering
 * an implementation here lets the fast path step aside while such scaling is active.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations are polled for every item draw on the client render thread, so
 * {@link #getAlphaMultiplier()} must be cheap and free of side effects.</p>
