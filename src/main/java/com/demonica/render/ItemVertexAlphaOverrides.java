/**
 * Query point for the {@link ItemVertexAlphaOverride}s that make Demonica's fast lit item path
 * unsound.
 *
 * <p>{@code ForgeHooksClient.renderLitItem} is intercepted by Demonica whenever no shader pack is in
 * use, and the interception either appends the baked quad data directly
 * ({@link FastLitItemDisplayListCache} aside) or compiles it into a cached display list keyed by
 * model identity and quad tint colours. A mod that scales item vertex alpha during a GUI
 * open/close animation - NeverEnoughAnimation does, through its {@code LightUtil.renderQuadColor}
 * and {@code BufferBuilder.color} hooks - is invisible to both shortcuts: the raw append drops the
 * scaling, and the display list bakes the alpha of the compile frame into the cache, which
 * {@code glCallList} then replays for every later frame (leaving chest GUI items permanently
 * transparent when the first frame of the fade is compiled).</p>
 *
 * <p>Registered sources are therefore polled before the fast path accepts a model; while any of
 * them is active the item is drawn through Forge's own {@code renderLitItem}, which keeps the fade
 * visible and never caches it.</p>
