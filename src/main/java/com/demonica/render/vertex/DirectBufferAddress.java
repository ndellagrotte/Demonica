/**
 * Resolves the native memory address of direct {@link ByteBuffer} instances and holds the

 *
 * <p>Motivation: the vertex write hot path performs absolute stores straight into the
 * staging buffer of {@code BufferBuilder} to avoid the per-call index and bounds work of
 * {@code ByteBuffer.putXxx}. The address itself comes from GTNHLib
 * {@code MemoryUtilities#memAddress0}, the same non-reflective entry point the other
 * raw-memory paths in this codebase already use. The single reflective lookup of
 * {@code sun.misc.Unsafe#theUnsafe} remains because no in-repo facility exposes an
 * {@code Unsafe} instance and the FFM API is unavailable under {@code --release 21};
 * all raw stores of the vertex writers route through this holder so
 * {@code sun.misc.Unsafe} is referenced from exactly one place.
