/**
 * Keeps HBM's first-person weapon depth handling out of Demonica's shader-pipeline hand pass.
 *
 * <p>HBM's Sedna weapon renderers ({@code com.hbm.render.item.weapon.sedna.ItemRenderWeaponBase})
 * choose their hand-depth strategy from OptiFine's shader state. With a shader pack loaded they ask
 * OptiFine for the vanilla hand-depth treatment; without one they clear the depth buffer so the held
 * weapon can never be clipped by world geometry. That probe goes through
 * {@code com.hbm.util.ShaderHelper}, which binds {@code net.optifine.shaders.Shaders} by name and
 * resolves to a no-op unless the OptiFine class exists. Demonica implements the shader pipeline
 * itself and ships no OptiFine class, so the probe is always negative here and the renderer takes
 * the "no shaders" branch.</p>
 *
 * <p>Taking that branch breaks the frame. {@code setPerspectiveAndRender} runs inside
 * {@link HandRenderer}, which renders the first-person hand against the world depth that the rest of
 * the pipeline reads back, so clearing the depth buffer there discards the world depth for every
 * depth-reading effect that follows. Replacing the clear with the projection compression OptiFine's
 * hand-depth treatment performs keeps the held weapon unclipped without touching the depth
 * contents.</p>
