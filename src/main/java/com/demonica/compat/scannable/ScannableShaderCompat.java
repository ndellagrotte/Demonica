/**
 * Adapter that lets Demonica stand in as the "shader mod" side of Scannable's OptiFine
 * integration ({@code li.cil.scannable.integration.optifine.ProxyOptiFine}).
 *
 * <p>Motivation (issue #94): Scannable's default scan-wave path ({@code injectDepthTexture=true},
 * mode {@code INJECT}) swaps the main framebuffer's {@code GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT} over to a private
 * depth texture and later restores it with {@code glFramebufferRenderbuffer(..., depthBuffer)}.
 * {@code FramebufferIrisMixin} replaces the vanilla depth renderbuffer with a shared depth
 * texture ({@code Framebuffer.depthBuffer} stays 0), so Scannable's restore detaches the depth
 * attachment entirely: terrain rendering afterwards has no depth buffer and loses
 * self-occlusion, which reads as see-through ground. With a shader pack active the same code
 * also runs while an Iris render target is bound, churning the gbuffer depth attachment and
 * drawing the additive scan quad into the pipeline's targets (white screen with ghosting).</p>
 *
 * <p>Scannable ships a dedicated path for external shader mods (mode {@code OPTIFINE}): it copies
 * the shader mod's depth texture into a private FBO right after world rendering and draws the
 * scan wave during the overlay phase. That path never touches the main framebuffer's attachments,
 * which is exactly what Demonica needs. {@code ProxyOptiFine} resolves OptiFine reflectively and
 * reports "no shader mod" when it is absent, so the Scannable mixin reroutes its two queries
 * ({@code isShaderPackLoaded} / {@code getDepthTexture}) here; Demonica's shared main-framebuffer
 * depth texture is the exact object Iris renders gbuffer depth into
 * ({@code DeferredWorldRenderingPipeline} constructs {@code RenderTargets} from it), so it carries
 * the world depth both with and without a shader pack.</p>
 *
 * <p>Assumption: Demonica's Cleanroom environment does not coexist with OptiFine, so when
 * {@code ProxyOptiFine} reports an OptiFine-managed depth texture we defer to it unchanged.</p>
