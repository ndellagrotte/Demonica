/**
 * Compatibility for ArchitectureCraft (mod id {@code architecturecraft}; the TridentMC and Spocel
 * releases share it).
 *
 * <p>ArchitectureCraft never relies on baked models for its world rendering. Its blockstates only
 * publish a {@code normal} variant (the runtime definition comes from its generated resource pack),
 * so every {@code facing=*} state resolves to Forge's {@code FancyMissingModel} in the bake
 * registry, and the real geometry is emitted by a {@code BlockRendererDispatcher} replacement that
 * {@code CustomBlockDispatcher.inject()} installs into {@code Minecraft.blockRenderDispatcher}
 * during postInit. The vanilla chunk rebuild calls that entry point and the blocks stay visible;
 * Celeritas's fast block renderer reads {@code BlockModelShapes.getModelForState} directly, hits the
 * missing model and skips the block (#101). The dispatcher replacement must therefore not be
 * bypassed: the compat forces ArchitectureCraft blocks down the vanilla dispatcher fallback,
 * whose {@code RenderTargetWorld} target writes into a {@code BufferBuilder} without touching GL,
 * which keeps it safe on mesh worker threads.</p>
