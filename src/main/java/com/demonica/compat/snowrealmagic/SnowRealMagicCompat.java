 * carries a {@code SnowTile}; the covered block's model is only re-emitted inside
 * {@code BlockRendererDispatcher.renderBlock} (SRM redirects this entry point and re-renders the
 * contained block at {@code RETURN}). Celeritas's fast block renderer meshes model blocks straight from
 * their baked model and never calls that entry point, so the covered block disappears from the
 * chunk. Blocks that SRM owns must therefore fall back to the vanilla dispatcher path.
