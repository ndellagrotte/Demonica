/**
 * Works around a re-entrance lock leak in the Cleanroom sponge-mixin 0.8.7 build.
 *
 * <p>During mixin select/prepare, legacy coremod ASM transformers (e.g. Techguns'
 * TechgunsASMTransformer) may trigger nested class loads via
 * {@code ClassWriter#getCommonSuperClass}. When the nested-loaded class is a mixin
 * target, {@code MixinProcessor.lockAndSelect}/{@code applyMixins} throw
 * {@code ReEntrantTransformerError} without popping the processor's
 * {@link ReEntranceLock}. The leaked lock depth makes every later
 * {@code applyMixins} call throw, which aborts the launch with
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError: net/minecraft/client/Minecraft}.
 *
 * <p>Once mixin select has completed and no transform is in progress on the
 * current thread, the lock depth must be zero; anything above zero is leaked.
 * Calling {@link #clearLeakedLock()} at that point restores the balanced state.
