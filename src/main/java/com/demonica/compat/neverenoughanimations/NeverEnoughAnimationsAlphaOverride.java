/**
 * Bridges NeverEnoughAnimation's GUI open/close fade (mod id {@code neverenoughanimations}) into
 * Demonica's fast lit item path.
 *
 * <p>NeverEnoughAnimation fades a GUI in and out by scaling the alpha of every item vertex it draws
 * while the animation runs, through mixins on {@code LightUtil.renderQuadColor},
 * {@code BufferBuilder.color} and {@code GlStateManager.color}. Forge routes item rendering - GUI
 * slots included, because {@code allowEmissiveItems} defaults to true - through
 * {@code ForgeHooksClient.renderLitItem}, which Demonica replaces with a fast path that writes baked
 * quad data directly and caches stable models in a display list. That path never runs the vanilla
 * vertex pipeline, so the fade was either lost (raw append) or baked into the display list at the
 * alpha of the frame that compiled it; with the fade starting at zero, chest GUI items stayed
 * invisible for as long as that cache entry lived (Actinium issue #145).</p>
 *
 * <p>This source reports the fade multiplier so the fast path steps aside for the duration of the
 * animation, which keeps the fade visible and keeps the cache clean.</p>
