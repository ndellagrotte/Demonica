/**
 * Recovers per-buffer blend directives ({@code blend.<program>.<buffer>}) that shaders.properties only enables for
 * Iris-era Minecraft versions.
 *
 * <p>shaders.properties is preprocessed with the real {@code MC_VERSION} (11202). Packs written for Iris often wrap
 * their per-buffer blend overrides in conditionals such as {@code #if MC_VERSION >= 11800 || MC_VERSION == 11605}.
 * Those conditionals track which loader versions understand the directive, not a Minecraft feature it depends on, yet
 * the pack's GLSL still relies on the override. For example, I Like Vanilla writes bit-packed lightmap and
 * reflectiveness data to colortex3 from {@code gbuffers_water}. Without {@code blend.gbuffers_water.colortex3 = off}
 * the translucent blend scales those bits by the fragment alpha, which follows the camera pitch, and the screen-space
 * reflections decode garbage and flicker.
 *
 * <p>Demonica supports per-buffer blending, so such directives are adopted from a second evaluation of the file as
 * {@link #IRIS_ERA_MC_VERSION}. Only per-buffer blend directives are adopted. Every other gated directive (program-wide
 * blend, alpha test, custom uniforms, clouds, buffer sizes, ...) keeps the environment evaluation, because it may
 * depend on things that only exist in newer Minecraft versions.
